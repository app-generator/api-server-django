## Start with Docker

@Todo

## Start Django Backend

> Edit Environment

Add a `.env` file to your project root directory and populate as follows:

```env
AUTH0_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_ID
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=YOUR_AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET

JWT_SECRET=YOUR_JWT_SECRET

DATABASE_URL=YOUR_DATABASE_URL
```

Here's how to get the required Auth0 details. You need to register a client (application) in your Auth0 dashboard.

Follow these steps to register a client with Auth0:

1. Open the [Auth0 Applications](https://manage.auth0.com/?_gl=1*1a4zekg*_ga*Mjg3MzE5NzcyLjE3MzcwMjU4MzA.*_ga_QKMSDV5369*MTczNzIwMTkzNy45LjEuMTczNzIwMTk1Ni40MS4wLjA.#/applications) section of the Auth0 Dashboard.
2. Click on the **Create Application** button.
3. Provide a **Name**, such as "GitHub Auth".
4. Choose `Single Page Web Applications` as the application type.
5. Click on the **Create** button.
6. Finally, note down your `Domain`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret` and add them to your `.env` file. Click the settings tab if you do not see them.

Choose a random string of letters and numbers for your `JWT_SECRET` and populate the `DATABASE_URL` with your database connection string.

> Install Dependencies

Run the following to install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

> Set Up Prisma

1. Run the following command to generate the Prisma client and apply migrations:

2. If you need to seed your database, you can add a `seed` script in the `prisma/seed.ts` file and run:

```bash
npx prisma db seed
```
